- 👋 Hi, I’m @benbdeitch. I'm a graduate of Adelphi University, with a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics. I'm currently working to make my way into the software engineering industry, with the plans of turning my hobby of programming into a full-time career. 
- 👀 I’m interested in topics of all varieties, particularly looking into full-stack web development, though I also have a yet largely unexplored interest in data science and analytics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of AWS Web Services, as well as brushing up my skills in programming Java, Python, Javascript, and a few other languages. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Not much, at the moment. At the very least, I don't have any current projects in mind. If for some reason, you have an idea or two, feel free to reach out. I don't have a lot of experience in the field, but I pride  myself on being a quick learner. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Benbdeitch@gmail.com is my email address that I use most. In time, I might have a Slack or other means of contacts set up, but for now, that'd be the best place.
